# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

Forked from: [cloudflare-internship-2020/internship-application-fullstack](https://github.com/cloudflare-internship-2020/internship-application-fullstack)

This is Ajay Rajnikanth's implementation of the coding challenge issued by cloudflare. I have satisfied all the basic requirements and 2 of the extra credit requirements. I was unable to do the 3rd due to a lack of a personal domain.

Note: the GitHub repo does not include the updated `wrangler.toml` for security reason.

Thank you CloudFlare for the opportunity.
